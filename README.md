# Connect-4-JavaFx

## Overview

I came to a point recently where I realized that my knowledge of Java has been far too limited in terms of practical usage of the language.  I felt that I was starting to only really use web technologies to make any kinds of meaningful programs.

So I made the decision to do some work with JavaFx to get the juices flowing again regarding working in Java.

## The project

When completed, this project will be a playable version of the popular game "Connect Four", including a decent looking GUI.  

It currently includes just a few classes and images, all of which will be created by me.

## Tools

I am using Sublime Text for all my coding with Adobe Illustrator for any graphics.  This project is also a good gateway into illustrator for me, since I prefer to use all of my own graphics.  I only recently began to use Illustrator and am still learning the ropes.
